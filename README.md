# ALX Listing App
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. 


# Folder Structure and Reusability:
1. Establish a clean folder structure, including directories for components/, interfaces/, constants/, and public/assets/.
2. Create reusable components such as Card and Button for modularity and scalability.

# TypeScript Integration:
1. Define TypeScript interfaces (CardProps, ButtonProps, etc.) in interfaces/index.ts to ensure type safety and code consistency.

# Asset Management:
Organize assets, including images and SVGs, under public/assets/ for easy access and maintenance.
